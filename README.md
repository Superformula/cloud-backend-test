# Superformula Cloud Backend Test Solution Diego Salas Noain

### Summary

This repository contains the solution for Superformula Cloud Backend Test. It is a GraphQL API that retrieves coordinates for a given address. The solution has been designed to comply with the requirements of extensible code and architecture, followed by Logging and traceability as well as solid testing.

## Solid Principles
* Single responsibility principle:
  * Controllers and services only handle one use case
* Open closed principle:
  * By using the decorator pattern (LogController) we can add functionality to a controller without modifying it.
* Interface segregation principle:
  * Every controller, service and repository implement in full their interfaces
* Dependency Inversion principle:
  * Controller’s dependencies and service’s dependencies are abstractions (interfaces) rather than implementations. Concrete implementation of a third-party library or a http client depends on the abstractions created and not the other way around (the dependency is inverted)

## Design Patterns
* Factory
* Decorator
* Adapter
* Dependency Injection
* Composition root

## Methodologies
* TDD
* Clean architecture
* Conventional Commits
* Continuous integration
* Object Oriented Design

## Features
* Error handling
* Unit test
* Integration test
* Coverage test
* Extensible code
* Logging and traceability

## Handling error strategy:
* Operational errors: predictable run-time errors of correctly written programs that may happen at some point
* Programming errors: bugs developers introduce to the code.

Errors are handled differently in development and production environments for best utility purposes.

Error in development environment with stack trace

Error in production environment with customized message for the user

## Tech Stack
* Typescript
* Serverles Framework
* API Gateway + AWS Lambda
* GraphQL

## Testing

Before testing make sure to:
-	create a file in the root of the project called: jest-env-vars.js, and add the following content:
```
process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN='you mapbox api access token in quotes'
```
This will ensure that integration tests can run properly

To run the tests you can choose from the following commands:

```
npm run test:unit
```
This will run all unit tests

```
npm run test:integration    
```
This will run all integration tests

```
npm run test:ci    
```
This will run a coverage test

## Repository structure
The solution is structured in the following directories
```

├── src                 # Source files of the solution
    ├── data            # Handles all business logic of the solution
    ├── domain          # Defines business logic protocols, models, and errors
    ├── infrastructure  # Implements third-party libraries, http clients, access db
    ├── main            # Performs composition root by creating a dependency graph
    └── presentation    # Handles incoming requests
```

## Environment variables
```
ACCESS_TOKEN            # stores mapbox api access token
NODE_ENV                # stores the application environemnt (development | production)
```

## Build

To build the solution run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a build folder optimized for production

## Run the solution

To run the solution, you can choose from these two options:
```
npm run start:prod
```
This will run the project simulating production environment

```
npm run start:dev
```
This will run the project in development mode

## Deployment guide

Before deployment make sure to:
-	Have a mapbox api access token 
-	Have configured AWS credentials locally with AWS CLI: (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

-	Install the serverless framework globally: npm install -g serverless (https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
-	Have in an .env file your environment variables 

To deploy the application run the following command:
```
npm run deploy
```
This will build the project first, and then it will use the serverless framework to translate the serverless.yml file to a single CloudFormation template which is then shipped to AWS.
