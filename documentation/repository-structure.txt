The main coding folders are pkg, serverless, terraform

pkg) this is the actual project implementation, all of the project's typescript is in here. With it, we'll create a github package and
export it to serve as a lambda layer. With that we shrink the deploy size. If we wanted to help the padronization we'd create a new package
only with the constants and enums

serverless) a serverless implementation to handle everything lambda related

terraform) terraform files to create the dynamo and appSync resources
